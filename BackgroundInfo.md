# Snake
Snake Game

If you would like to understand the code I have commented with some explanation as to what parts of the code do. If you would like a more indepth idea, youtube or google have great explanations to the conecpts as I'm sure you know.

This was my first project outside of class in C. I wanted to use concepts I am unfarmiliar with and would like to get used, to which is why some parts of the program may feel odd to other programmers.

I'm mainly a java programmer but have been learning c the last cpuple months an thought this would be a perfect test for what I have learned at uni. I also didnt see many tutorials on how to do this in C so i thought it would be good as I would have little help and have to rely on myself.

This is a list of the programming concepts used:
structures
linked lists
2d arrays
pointers (barely but got a better understanding through this project)
select(though i did have a lot of googling to get this and i now only have a basde understanding)
Ncurses
maybe a few more.

Thank you for reading.
