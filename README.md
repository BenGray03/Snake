Snake Game

If you would like to understand the code i have commented with some explanation as to what parts of the code do. if you would like a more indepth youtube or google have great explanations to the conecpts as im sure you know.

This was my first prpject outside of class in C. I wanted to use concepts I am unfarmiliar with and would like to get used to which is why some parts of the program may feel odd to other programmers.

I'm mainly a java prgrammer but have been learning c the last cpuple months an thought this would be a perfect test for what i have learned at uni. I also didnt see many tutorials on how to do this in C so i thought it would be good as i would have little help and have to rely on myself

Thank you for reading.
